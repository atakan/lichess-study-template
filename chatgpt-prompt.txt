The second row of the input file contains the tournament name. Then
there are a number of rows. One of these start with the cell
containing "İsim". The fifth cell of this row contains the name of our
player. There is another row, beginning with a
cell, containing "Ulusal rating"; the fifth cell in this row contains
the national rating of the player. After these lines, there is an
empty row. The important table begins with a row, where the first
cell contains the word "Tur". This row is the header for the
table. The table ends with an empty row. Each line in this table
contains a match between our player and an opponent. The first column of this
table (with header "Tur") is the round number, the second column (with
header "Masa") is the board number, the fifth column is the opponent
name given as "First Name(s), Last Name(s)", the sixth row is the
rating of the opponent, the ninth row is the result of the game given
as a letter (b for white, s for black) followed by a number (1: player
won, 0: player lost,  ½: game is a draw). The program should read all
this information and print out a PGN file containing all the
games. The PGN file should contain the fields "Event", "Round",
"Board", "White", "Black", "Result". Assume that all games had only moves
"1. e4 e5".
